# Cores, Shards, Pills, and More

All of these items refer broadly to items which are used to enhance, augment, or further one's own cultivation base.


### Cores
Cores are hyper-dense essence structures that form inside [Cultivators](Cultivators.md), [Spirit Beasts](Spirit%20Beasts.md), and [Monsters](Monsters.md), as well as (more rarely) in locations that experience a high density of ambient [Essence](Essence.md). 

They most often appear as a small orb, approximately 1-3 Inches in Diameter. Every core is different, but society has broken them down into a series of characteristics for determining their value. Every core is rated according to it's *Affinity, Grade, and Purity*.

*Affinity* is a broad categorization of the Dao that was likely used to form it. While it's nearly impossible to tell a Core that comes from a Fire Elemental from one that formed inside the a Sect dedicated to the [Path of Flames](../Paths/Path%20of%20Flames.md), we can easily determine that both are heavily associated with the Fire element, and Paths that are compatible with that element would benefit from using the core.

*Grade* refers to the tier of power of the Core itself. This is an indicator for cultivators to determine how safe it is for them to make use of the Core. Higher Grade cores are far too dense with Essence for low grade cultivators to withstand safely in cultivation, and Low Grade Cores aren't dense enough to cause improvement in the meridians of someone pushing towards Immortality.

*Purity* is simply a rating of how much 'other' essence the Core contains relative to it's primary Affinity. Most Cores with Ratings above 50% are considered "junk" cores, and used to power rituals, magic, and essence-based technology instead of being actively cultivated. There are some known Paths that are capable of either converting junk essence or that make use of mish-mash essence well. Practitioners of those paths are known to advance quickly through the early ranks due to being able to obtain cheap materials, but they have a tendency to hit much harder bottlenecks as they progress.

**Cores**
| Grade| XP Value | XP:GP Ratio| GP Cost|
|----|----|----|----|
|F|100|1|100|
|E|200|1|200|
|D|400|2|800|
|C|800|2|1600|
|B|1600|3|4800|
|A|3200|3|9600|
|S|6400|5|32000|


### Shards 
A "Shard" broadly refers to a piece of a Core that has been shattered or broken. If the chunk of core retains enough size after being broken, that chunk may retain some of it's former strength.

Shards use the same rating system as Cores, but usually only have 1/10th the value of a normal Core for it's Grade.

**Shards**
| Grade| XP Value | XP:GP Ratio| GP Cost|
|----|----|----|----|
|F|10|1|10|
|E|20|1|20|
|D|40|2|80|
|C|80|2|160|
|B|160|3|480|
|A|320|3|960|
|S|640|5|3200|


### Pills

Pills, Herbs and other cultivation aids are medical concoctions created by alchemists to improve cultivation.

The effects of a Pill can vary wildly. Some pills effects include (but are not limited to):
- Increased XP gained from cultivation
- Immediate XP gain as though cultivating a Core or Shard
- Advantage against Cultivation Accidents
- Increased [Essence](Essence.md) Points
