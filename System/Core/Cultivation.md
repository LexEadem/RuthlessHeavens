Cultivation is the process of gathering [Essence](Essence.md), and forming it into yourself through your meridians. This manifests as [Experience Points](System/Core/Experience%20Points.md) and is the primary method of gaining XP.

Maintaining passive Cultivation takes 1 hr per day, but may be done *during* a short rest.

Active Cultivation (absorbing things like Shards and Core) takes 1 hour per 50 XP consumed from the source, with a minimum of 1 hour.
