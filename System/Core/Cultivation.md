Cultivation is the process of gathering [[Essence]] from the world around you or Essence-dense objects ((such as [[Shards and Cores]])), and forming it into yourself through your meridians. This manifests as [[Experience Points]] and is the primary method of gaining XP.

Maintaining passive Cultivation takes 1 hr per day, but may be done *during* a short rest.

Active Cultivation (absorbing things like Shards and Core) takes 1 hour per 50 XP consumed from the source, with a minimum of 1 hour.
