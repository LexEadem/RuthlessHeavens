Sometimes things go wrong, usually because someone got greedy and attempted something they weren’t ready for.

## Price of Avarice

You attempted to cultivate from a source that was too far beyond your understanding. Consult this chart, to determine how many rolls you must make against the Penalty for Failure chart.

*Note that you cannot gain [Essence](System/Core/Essence.md) from a source more than 1 rank below your own.

|  | F | E | D | C | B|A|S|
| --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|**F**|0|0|1|2|5|10|20|
|**E**|0|0|0|1|2|5|10|
|**D**|-|0|0|0|1|2|5|
|**C**|-|-|0|0|0|1|2|
|**B**|-|-|-|0|0|0|1|
|**A**|-|-|-|-|0|0|0|
|**S**|-|-|-|-|-|0|0|

  

The heavens are fair, but ruthless. You took a big risk. Roll a d20 against the chart below to determine what your greed will cost you. However, if you took that risk with the assistance of a master at least 2 ranks higher than you, you gain advantage on this roll. You may also use the Lucky Feat to gain advantage on this roll if you have it. If you have to make multiple rolls against this chart, advantage applies to every roll and not just the first.  
  
Outcomes are not applied until all rolls are complete unless otherwise specified.

|D20|Outcome|
|----|----|
|1|Broken Cultivation. You may no longer absorb shards or cores, you lose access to ALL Essence abilities. This effect is permanent, and only children’s tales speak of those who ever came back from it.<br> You do not gain anything from this cultivation. All other rolls cease and all other outcomes are removed.|
|2-3|Crippled Growth. You permanently receive 20% less experience and essence from all sources, rounded up.<br> You do not gain anything from this cultivation.|
|4-5|Muddied Pathways. Your body is filled with impurities, and you must clean them. You lose access to all Essence Abilities until you restore your pathways. This process will require that you burn 10,000XP worth of Essence clearing the impurities and spend at least 30 days focusing entirely on the process. All experience spent this way is forfeit, and is not added to your XP totals.<br> You do not gain anything from this cultivation.|
|6-10|Heaven’s Wrath. Lightning strikes you and you immediately fall to 0 HP and begin making Death Saves. No magical effects can prevent your HP from reaching 0, though you can be saved from death by healing. If you do survive, you are also Wracked with Pain (as below).<br> You do not gain anything from this cultivation.|
|11-12|Wracked with Pain. You experience excruciating pain as excessive energy floods your pathways. This pain lasts for 1 week, you gain disadvantage to all ability checks and attacks until the pain recedes.<br> You gain 10% of the attempted cultivation amount.|
|13-14|Overloaded. The energy was too dense for you to manage, and it leaks out of your body. Any creatures within 1 mile capable of sensing essence will be alerted to the presence of a strong source of it and may be drawn to your location.<br> You gain 50% of the attempted cultivation amount.|
|15-17|You manage to defy the heavens and rise above your station. You gain full experience from this attempt as though you were the same grade as the source.<br> No Penalty.|
|18|Tribulation brings Enlightenment. You gain a glimpse into the Dao beyond your standing. Gain 10% increased experience and essence from all sources until you are one rank below the source of this attempt, this bonus applies to the current attempt.<br> No Penalty.|
|19|The heavens take notice of you and grant you a boon, you may choose one of the following.<br> - The heavens remove one other result of this attempt (Except Dao Reformation or Broken Cultivation), and will change it at their whim. (DM will reroll a new outcome for that roll in secret. It must be different from what was rolled, but could be anything.)<br> - Gain an additional 50% experience from this cultivation attempt.<br> - Gain Tribulation brings Enlightenment (as above).<br> - The heavens grant you a vision of the Dao, with a suggestion for progressing on your path.|
|20|Dao Reformation. Your pathways are fully overwhelmed, re-forged by the essence you are absorbing as a chaotic storm sweeps through you. You seize control of the storm and prevent it from destroying you, but your cultivation will be forever changed by the experience you have gone through. Your Dao changes to reflect more closely to the affinity of the source you absorbed. Work with your DM to determine your new Dao and how your abilities change.<br> You gain experience as normal from the attempt. All other rolls cease and all other outcomes are removed.|
