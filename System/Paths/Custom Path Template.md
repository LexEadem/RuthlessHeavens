Founder: <Name of Path’s founder, or character name for an Original path>

Dao Concepts: <Themes of the concept. This should be very general and limited in the early stages for an original path. Allow it to be refined as the character advances..>

  

#### Growth Chart:  
<A typical growth chart. These should almost always be the same, but some paths will lose a Benefit to gain an additional manifestations, or they will eschew manifestations for additional passive effects. Many craftsman or scholarly paths have little in the way of Manifestations, but make up for it with extremely powerful benefits suited to their needs.>

####   
  
Abilities & Benefits:

  

First Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a cantrip. A small effect that is usable at will. It may be occasionally useful, but mostly serves as a small manifestation of power.  
  
Path Benefit 1:

Trivial benefit, these benefits should be an always active, but only useful in very specific circumstances.  
  
Examples:  
Some Blacksmiths at the Silver stage can determine the exact temperature of any heat source to extreme accuracy.  
Perfect sense of time  
Can always tell distance to the surface

Extra carry weight

  
  
Second Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a 1st level spell (or lower). This is intended to be a bread-and-butter ability for the path. It will be the character’s go-to move and should be considered core to the ‘style’ of the path. Many paths have a direct enhancement or defensive ability here, boosting their Strength, imbuing their attacks with additional damage, or throwing up shield to defend from attacks.  
  
These abilities should enhance in strength slowly with character growth. For example, if the Manifestion let you add 1d6 fire damage to attacks, increases it by another 1d6 for every 2 ranks. (2d6 at Gold, and 3d6 at Mithril).  
  
Path Benefit 2:

Minor benefit. Should be always active, useful in common scenarios and provide a noteworthy advantage to the Path, without being overly “powerful”  
  
Example:  
+5ft to base movement speed.  
+1 to Save DC with affinity school or element  
+1 AC Innate bonus when barefoot  
+2-5 to certain skill checks. Higher values are for highly specific scenarios, lower values can apply more broadly to the skill.  
  
  

  
Third Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a 3rd level spell (or lower). These are usually either personal enhancements or a “big gun” ability used for stronger opponents, whichever the path is more suited to using regularly.  
  
  
  
Path Benefit 3:  
Moderate Benefit. Always active, this should be a defining feature of the path. These are often either small enhancements to earlier benefits (such as an additional +1 AC or +5ft movement), or a stronger but new benefit.  
  
Examples:  
+5ft movement (stacks with Benefit 2)  
Benefits while using a certain maneuver (IE: +3 to grapple challenges, +2 AC while dodging)  
Darkvision 30ft  
Blindsight or Tremorsense 15ft  
Additional Attribute points in a specific attribute  
Bonus health

Permanent ‘Feather Fall’ effect  
Can run on water or walls

-1 essence cost of an essence ability  
  
  

  
Fourth Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a 5th level spell (or lower). These are usually either personal enhancements or a “big gun” ability used for stronger opponents, whichever was not obtained at the previous tier.  
  
Path Benefit 4:

Major Benefit. Always active, this should be a defining feature of the path. These are often either enhancements to earlier benefits (such as an additional +2 AC or +10ft movement), or a stronger but new benefit.  
  
At this point, the benefits should be somewhat comparable even to creatures that naturally have these features, and with skilled use will make the character extremely dangerous in the scenarios their path excels at. For an idea of scale, a character on a stealth-benefiting path should end up roughly twice as good at staying hidden as a generalist rogue at this point.  
  
Examples:  
+10ft movement  
Incredible Maneuvers (IE +5 to Grapple tests)  
+5-10 to Stealth Checks (Situational requirements increase this towards 10)  
Darkvision 60ft  
Blindsight or Tremorsense 30ft  
+1-2 to Save DCs for spells  
Maintain a *specific* effect or spell without it’s Concentration requirement  
-2 essence cost of an essence ability  
  
Fifth Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a 7th level spell (or lower). This ability is usually a wide-area attack with ruthless efficiency, which is why it is known to be a terrible idea to attempt to swarm a powerful cultivator with large numbers of weak opponents.  
  
Obviously, a path with a single target focus (like something suited for assassination) would go with something more direct here.  
  
Path Benefit 5:

Extreme Benefit. Always active, this should be a showstopping feature of the path. These are often either enhancements to earlier benefits, or a stronger but new benefit. New benefits tend to be the most common form at this stage.  
  
At this point, the benefits should be equal to or stronger than the creatures that naturally have these features, and with skilled use will make the character extremely dangerous in the scenarios their path excels at.  
  
Examples:  
Can Concentrate on an additional effect  
Immunity to instant death effects (IE: PW:K)  
Convert a maneuver into a Bonus Action.  
Darkvision 120ft  
Blindsight or Tremorsense 60ft  
+2-3 to Save DCs for spells  
Damage Reduction  
-3 essence cost of an essence ability  
  
  
Final Dao Manifestation:

This should be an ability similar in strength to a 9th level spell (or lower). These are world-shattering powers, used sparingly and in dire circumstances. You may be immortal, but you are not (yet) a God. Be careful you do not reach above your station and invoke the wrath of the Heavenly Realms.  
  
Path Mastery:

A Dao-Defining passive effect. These are usually at least twice as powerful as the preceding ability.  
  
Examples:  
Flight (60ft)  
Darkvision (240ft)  
Blind/Tremorsense (120ft)

+30ft Base Movement speed  
+4-6 Save DC for spells  
Additional mana/spell slots (Enough for a 9th level spell)  
An Additional Essence Ability is learned
