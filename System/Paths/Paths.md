There is no one path to reach the heavens, and oneâ€™s true Dao is always unique to the self. But following in the footsteps of those who came before is a trusted method to achieving great heights. Not all paths are made equal, and following those known to lead to greatness will help guide your way.  
  
These are some examples of the paths of those who came before.
