Normally in 5th Edition games killing monsters and roleplaying will grant Experience Points relative to the challenge rating of the Encounter.

In the Ruthless Heavens, Experience is equivalent of Essence, and must be actively cultivated. Killing creatures does not provide Experience. Instead, encounters should either reward adventurers with sufficient [[Shards and Cores]] to equal an appropriate amount of Experience for the encounter, or enough Gold to purchase those Cores.

This means that under this system, Experience and Gold and intimately tied, and DMs will need to be somewhat more careful with their economy than with traditional games.
