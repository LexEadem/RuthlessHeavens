When people discuss "The Heavens" they refer to several things which comprise the broader concept. 

The Heavens, or "Ruthless Heavens" to many, can be broken down into 3 parts.

The first part is the broad system of laws and mathematics which govern the flow of the world. This is physics, magic, essence, and pure luck as it exists in the world. Everything from how a Wizard can conjure a Fireball to how Druids can take animal shape, to how Cultivation manifests in finite divisible stages of progress.

The second part of the Heavens, is the literal deiform entities that exist on higher (and lower) planes and who exert control of their aspects of Dao on the mortal realms. These beings are known to be capricious in nature, and frequently bother or help mortals for their own amusement.

The third part people refer to when discussing "The Heavens" is the Dao itself as a construct. A common theory among Mortal Scholars is that the Gods are not the pinnacle of existence, and that there exists a power above them that guides the Dao, the Gods, and even Fate itself. The most common refrain when discussing this power directly is "From where do the Gods obtain their power?" It is not known if this theory is correct, as no Immortal or Deity has ever been forthcoming on the topic to those who inquire.
