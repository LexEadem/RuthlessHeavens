Sometimes called the “Half-Step Immortal”, cultivators in the Dao Seeking stage of advancement have mastered their inner selves entirely, and now push the boundaries of their power into the world around them. They are beacons of power, and some of the greatest examples of their Paths. For nearly all who achieve this stage, it will be their last. Most cultivators will perish or burn out in their quest towards the Immortal stage.  
  
Less than 1% of people will achieve this stage in their lifetime. Those rare commoners who do are the smiths and artisans of legend, their creations sitting in gilded halls or fiercely protected for centuries at the deepest layers of the strongest dungeons. It is said that a blacksmith at this stage of advancement is capable of creating a weapon packed so dense with Essence that it develops a will of its own.

### Essence Abilities:

Unbreakable Soul (Passive):

Flames are of no concern to those who walk it’s Path. You can no longer be harmed by the element of the Dao you have mastered. The Resistance or Advantage granted by your Golden Fortitude advances to Immunity. For those giving back to their juniors on the path, this serves as an ideal tool for training the young, as they can freely use their powers of the Dao on you without risking harm to their opponent.  
  
This ability is the reason for the tradition of non-conflict with others on the same path. Should two cultivators clash with similar Paths, they will destroy only the world around them with their goals unmet.. Most resolve disputes with contests; or games of skill or luck.  
  
Path Benefit  
Unlock the fifth Benefit of your Path. These benefits vary greatly from path to path.

  

Fifth Dao Manifestation (Active):

Cost: 5 Essence

As First Dao, except imitating a spell of up to 7th level.

For Example, a cultivator on the Path of Flames may be able to replicate the effect of Fire Storm
