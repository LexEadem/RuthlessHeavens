At the Foundation Stage, the Cultivator has built the principles of the Dao within themselves, and prepared themselves for their journey through life. The energy of the heavens strengthens them, and gives them vitality; staving off simple sickness and improving their hardiness.  
  
Most people achieve this stage in their teens or early adulthood, though (as is true of all stages) some genius cultivators will reach it at a far younger age.  
  
Cultivators in the Foundation stage may have discovered a Path to follow, but they have not yet manifested the Nature of that path and confer no abilities from it. They are not true Mystic Artists, they have yet had merely a glimpse of the Dao.  
  
For commoners this is anyone working at the very bottom rung of society, or still in their apprenticeship, and those who did not have the dedication to see their cultivation through.

### Essence Abilities:

**Vital Essence (Passive)**  
The Cultivator is resistant to mundane sickness and ailments, and recovers from both more quickly than those who never set foot on the Path. Gain Advantage on Constitution saves against mundane disease and poisons, and when testing for broken bones. The time to recover from broken bones and mundane disease without magical assistance is halved.  
  
**Cultivate Essence (Passive)**

Cultivators can sense the essence in their immediate surroundings, including its density and type (if they are familiar with that type enough to identify it). This sense begins faint but grows to be extremely precise by the Silver & Gold stages. By cycling the essence within their body with intent, they may pull the essence around them into themselves and gain Experience. Unless in an area where the essence is extremely dense, the amount of gain from this method will be noticeable over months, not hours.  
  
Gain 100xp per year if maintaining regular mediation sessions of at least 1 hr per day in an F grade environment. More regular mediation or higher grade environments may raise this amount.  
  
Essence may also be cultivated from highly dense physical manifestations, called Shards and Cores. You may cultivate from Cores and Shards no more than 1 rating below your own cultivation rank, as anything less will contain too many impurities to be useful to your cultivation. Using shards and cores from above your rank is possible, but very dangerous. Roll against the Cultivation Accident charts for the outcomes.
