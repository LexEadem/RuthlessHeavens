At the Body Cultivation stage, the practitioner has infused their body with Essence, and carved a network of pathways for it to flow within them. While some will have taken the first few steps down their Path, most have not touched on their true Dao yet.  
  
For commoners, this is the achievement reached by most upon finishing their apprenticeship and starting out as a true professional.

  

Beginning at this stage, taking on Essence of an appropriate type to your intended Dao becomes important. Essence sources of inappropriate affinity may provide less experience than expected. Intake of excessive essence that is inappropriate for your Dao may have unforeseen consequences to your cultivation.

### Essence Abilities:  
Path Benefit:  
Unlock a trivial Benefit of your Path. These benefits vary greatly from path to path.  
  
Bronze Body (Passive):  
Your body has grown stronger from your diligent cultivation. Gain 1 attribute point in Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina.

First Dao Manifestation (Active):  
Cost: 0 Essence
Use an Essence Point to manifest an aspect of your Dao. Work with the DM to determine an appropriate manifestation. These are usually similar to Cantrip-level spell effects. As an Example, a cultivator on the Path of Flames may be able to use the “Produce Flame” cantrip this way. The form of this manifestation is chosen when this ability is gained, and cannot be changed without undergoing significant alterations to one’s Dao.  
  
These manifestations (and their higher level versions) do are considered creature abilities, not spells.
