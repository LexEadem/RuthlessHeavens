For commoners, those who reach this stage are considered the experts of their path. Producing high quality and reliable goods. Only half of people will achieve this stage in their lifetime.

### Essence Abilities:

Silver Sight (Active):  
Cost: 1 Essence

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You can view the essence in your surroundings. Aspects of the true nature of the world are in plain view to you. While magical items often have a strong aura related to their essence type, this ability cannot distinguish between magical and non-magical causes. Nor can it identify Schools of Magic.  
IE: A Rod of Disintegration and a mundane Sacrificial Dagger may both produce extremely potent auras of Death, Silver Sight would not be able to determine which is magical.

Second Dao Manifestation (Active):  
Cost: 1 Essence

As First Dao, except imitating a spell of up to 1st level.
