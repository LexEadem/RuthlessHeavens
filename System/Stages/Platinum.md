Where Silver represents the mastery of one’s mind & body, the Platinum or “Spirit Sealing” rank represents the mastery of your own Spirit. In this stage of advancement, the cultivator achieves unity of soul and body. Their senses are expanded, and their aura becomes a power unto itself.  
  
Less than 10% of people will achieve this stage in their lifetime. Among Commoners, these people are the great smiths and renowned masters of their field. Experts workers and unparalleled minds.

### Essence Abilities:

Tyrannical Presence (Passive):  
While all cultivators exhibit an Aura, at the Platinum stage it has grown to be a weapon in it’s own right. Within a 50ft Radius, creatures in line of sight at Gold Rank or below (or equivalent strength) can sense the weight of your strength as a chasm of power that separates you.. Creatures at Bronze Rank or below must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) to act aggressively toward you as long as they can feel your presence. As you advance to higher realms, these two thresholds increase at the same rate. (ie: When you are Mithril, Silver beings must make a Wisdom saving throw). At Mithril the radius of this aura extends to 100ft. At Immortal your Aura extends to 200ft.  
  
As a bonus action, you may suppress or enable Tyrannical Presence at will. Most Cultivators keep their Presence concealed at all times, though some Platinums prefer brandishing their power over the weak in lieu of being polite.
